# Game Theme

The game theme is based on the Banjo-Kazooie. A collectathon based platformer game with the goal focusing on exploring the world and completing quests in each world while attaining appropriate collectibles to progress through the game.

**Pre-Defined BK Village:**

This is the village in which BK lives their peaceful life. The environmet will have their friends house and a community of people , and will be different from Spiral Mountain. This village features shops, houses, and a kingdom for their village master as in Paper Mario.

**Cutscene at the start of the game:**

A similar cutscene as in Banjo-Kazooie for starting the game journey. The main characters' sister will be kidnapped by a witch for acquiring her beauty. The witch lives in a substantially distanced place in which her lair is present, which is outside of the BK's village. After the main character coming to known by their friend that his sister is kidnapped by a witch, they start to investigate further and decides to start their journey. *Note: This entire cutscene can be changed accordingly and this is just for a starting idea.*

**Hub World:**

Once BK steps outside the village, there will be hub world introduction, starting with a cutscene of introducing the hub world common environments. It is upto to the user of the engine to design how the hub-world should be.

**Game Worlds:**

Hub world will connect with each worlds and the player should progress through each worlds one by one to finally reach the access to the lair. There will be a certain collectible that acts as a key which has to be collected for accessing other worlds.

**World Design:**

It is upto to the engine user to design the worlds based on different themes. The goal is to make the player collect some certain collectible by immersing them in the quest journey with the explorative mind.
