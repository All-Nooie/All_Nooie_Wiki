# Game Theme

The game theme is based on the Banjo-Kazooie. A collectathon based platformer game with the goal focusing on exploring the world and helping others by completing quests while attaining appropriate collectibles to progress through the game.

**Predefined cutscene at the inital stage (can be changed to adapt to a different storyline):**

The main characters BK will live a peaceful life in their village with their friends (as in Spiral Mountains). Suddenly, a witch with a evil plan attacks their village master in the neighour village (as in Isle o' Hags). The witch found the formula to gain immortality by sucking the life force of the living beings and so, she attacks the village master to gain a maximum amount of life force. BK has completed several adventures in the past and so, a certain character comes to inform BK for getting help and they decide to start their journey.

**Predefined cutscene at the final stage (can be changed to adapt to a different storyline):**

The main characters BK will reach the lair in which the life force sucking machine is being used and the immortality potion was being invented by the witch. There BK has to fight with the witch and restore the village master back to life by releasing the life force. Once the final boss is defeated, a final post ending cutscene of BK with their friends enjoying in a beach will be shown and the game will end.

**Game Progress:**

The idea for the person using this engine is to come up with different theme-based worlds each having interesting quests to solve. It is upto the game designer to decide on whether the worlds should be independent or inter-connected or a certain thing to collect and so on. (It's kinda Luffy crew's goal is to reach One Piece, but the actual progress in each island is what makes the story interesting)
