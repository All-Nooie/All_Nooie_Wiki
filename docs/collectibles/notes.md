# Notes

- **Purpose**: Guide players in exploring the world and track progress for unlocking "note doors" in the hub world.
- **Total in Each World**: There are 100 notes available in each world, totaling 900 notes across 9 worlds.
- **Collection Style**: As in Banjo-Tooie, encouraging freedom in interconnected world-building. There won't be a concept where the highest accumulated notes in each world count towards the overall total.
- **Collection Types and Their Placement in the World**:
    - **1-Note Item**: Helps players explore the world.
    - **5-Note Item**: Rewards for navigating medium-difficulty sections.
