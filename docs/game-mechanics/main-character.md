# Main Character Mechanics

The design of the main character is completely modifyable using modding feature.

**Pre-Defined Main Character:**

A bear and bird in which the bird will be inside the backpack, that is weared by the bear (as in Banjo-Kazooie).

**Pre-Defined Moves:**

The player can:

1) Move with normal speed.
2) Walk slowly using a helper key like Cntrl or something else.
3) Run faster using a helper key like Shift or something else.

These are provided to avoid players using attack moves to navigate the world for the sake of moving quicker.

*For example, in Banjo-Kazooie, some people will use rolling and jump to navigate the world faster, which gives the player a sense of boring. Running action that is explicitly provided will help them use it instead of using the substitute actions.*

**Learning Moves before starting the journey:**

Note that concepts like special eggs, special feathers, disk pads, power-up shoes won't be teached here. i.e. The basics of how the main character acts without any external factors considering, that is only will be teached in the BK village.

In BK village, there will be a training like area in which a certain character will teach how to use basic moves. All moves that are used throughout the game of Banjo-Kazooie will be teached.

Learnable moves in the training area: Moves from the page [Banjo-Kazooie abilities](https://banjokazooie.fandom.com/wiki/Abilities) that is core to the character without any external factors.

This one is provided as skippable option also because the fan-game players wouldn't want to do all these.

**Energy bar and life trophies:**

The main character will have the honeycombs as energy bar which will reduce by a unit of 1 on each enemy attack. We can keep 5 as the max count and the initial count provided will be 5.

*The concept honeycomb can be changable via the modding feature.*

The main character will have the life trophies as lives which will reduce by a unit of 1 on each time the energy bar runs out. We can keep 9 as the max count and the initial count provided will be 3.

*The concept life trophy can be changable via the modding feature.*
